US Customary
1 Aubergine
1 white onion
2 cloves of garlic
½ thumb sized piece of ginger
1 red pepper
3 tbsp of tamari/ soy sauce
3 tbsp of water
1 tin of butter bean or bean of choice 400g
1 tin of chopped tomatoes 400g
1 tin of coconut milk 400g
2 tbsp of curry powder
½ head of pak choi
½ lemon

INSTRUCTIONS
1 Peel and finely chop the onion, garlic and ginger. Slice the aubergine into small 1cm cubes. 
Slice the red pepper into long thin strips. Finely slice the pak choi. Drain and rinse the beans

2 Heat a wide bottom non-stick pan on high heat, once hot add ½ tbsp of oil along with the onions 
and fry for 4 mins stirring regularly, until they start to go golden, then add the garlic and ginger 
and cook for another 1-2 mins. Next add the aubergine and cook for 2-3 mins stirring regularly. 
In a mug mix together the tamari and water. Add the peppers and the aubergine water mix to the pan and 
put a lid on to trap the steam to move from frying to briaising or steaming. Stir occasionally and if 
the aubergine starts to stick add another 2-3 tbsp of water and scrape any sticky veg from the pan until 
it incorporates into the sauce. Cook for approx 6-8 mins, at this point the aubergine should be soft and 
melt in your mouth (they should not be rubbery if they are, they need longer to cook!).

3 Next add the chopped tomatoes, coconut milk, beans and curry powder and cook for 3 mins mixing well, 
add the pak choi and juice of ½ the lemon.

4 Finally taste and adjust the seasoning to your liking by adding more salt, black pepper, lemon juice or 
chilli or aromatic spices. Serve with your favourite grain of choice and enjoy!
